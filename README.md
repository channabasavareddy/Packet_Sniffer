🐍 Packet Sniffer – Python-Based Network Analysis Tool
A lightweight and modular packet sniffer built in Python for analyzing network traffic in real time. Designed for cybersecurity learning and diagnostics, this tool filters, logs, and dissects packets with clarity and precision. Containerized via Docker and tested in Kali Linux.
🚀 Features
- Protocol Parsing: Captures raw Ethernet frames, decodes headers (IP, TCP, UDP, ICMP), and extracts packet metadata.
- Custom Filtering: Target traffic by source/destination IP, protocol, or port number for focused inspection.
- Structured Logging: Outputs timestamped logs with packet details for forensic analysis or auditing.
- Docker Integration: Deploy securely across different systems with consistent runtime using Docker.
- Kali Linux Testing: Validated in penetration testing environments for accuracy and reliability.
- Live Monitoring: Terminal-based display with real-time capture and verbosity control.
