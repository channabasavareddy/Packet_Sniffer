🐍 Packet Sniffer – Python-Based Network Analysis Tool
A lightweight and modular packet sniffer built in Python for analyzing network traffic in real time. Designed for cybersecurity learning and diagnostics, this tool filters, logs, and dissects packets with clarity and precision. Tested in Kali Linux.

- 📦 Built a custom packet sniffer in Python using libraries such as socket, struct, and scapy to capture and analyze raw network traffic across multiple protocols.
- 🐳 Containerized the application using Docker, enabling portable, secure deployment and consistent runtime behavior across varied environments.
- 🧪 Executed thorough testing in Kali Linux, validating real-time packet monitoring and protocol dissection in a cybersecurity lab setup.
- 🔍 Implemented features to filter and log packets by IP address, port number, and protocol type for enhanced traffic inspection and forensic readiness.
- 🧾 Generated structured output logs with timestamped packet metadata, useful for network diagnostics and intrusion detection workflows.
- 🔒 Configured the sniffer for educational and ethical use, ensuring traffic capture was limited to authorized interfaces and controlled environments.
- 📘 Documented setup, usage instructions, and sample outputs, streamlining user onboarding and showcasing clarity in technical writing.

🚀 Features
- Protocol Parsing: Captures raw Ethernet frames, decodes headers (IP, TCP, UDP, ICMP), and extracts packet metadata.
- Custom Filtering: Target traffic by source/destination IP, protocol, or port number for focused inspection.
- Structured Logging: Outputs timestamped logs with packet details for forensic analysis or auditing.
- Docker Integration: Deploy securely across different systems with consistent runtime using Docker.
- Kali Linux Testing: Validated in penetration testing environments for accuracy and reliability.
- Live Monitoring: Terminal-based display with real-time capture and verbosity control.
